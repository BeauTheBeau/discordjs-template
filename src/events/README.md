# src/events

> This is the documentation for the events directory.

This directory handles all the events that are emitted by the bot. The events are emitted by the [client].
Events are registered and executed by the [eventHandler](../handlers/eventHandler.js).

## Creating a new event

To create a new event, create a new file in this directory. The file name should be the name of the event. For example,
if you want to handle the `messageCreate` event, the file name should be `messageCreate.js`. The file should export the
`name`, `once` and `execute` properties. Where `name` is the name of the event, `once` is a boolean that indicates if the
event should only be executed once and `execute` is the function that will be executed when the event is emitted.

### Example

```js
module.exports = {
  name: "messageCreate",
  once: false,
  execute(client, message) {
    client.logger.info(`Message received: ${message.content}`);
  },
};
```

## List of events

Discord.js has a helper enum, [`Events`][events], that contains all the events that can be emitted by the client.

### Example

```js
const { Events } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
  name: Events.MessageCreate,
  once: false,
  execute(client, message) {
    client.logger.info(`Message received: ${message.content}`);
  },
};
```
