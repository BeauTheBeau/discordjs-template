# Documentation

In (most) directories, you will find a `README.md` file that explains the purpose of the directory and how to use it.
This file is the main documentation for the project and should be read first. It also contains links to other
documentation files. We also aim to include a JSDoc comment at the top of each file that explains the purpose of the file
and how to use it.
