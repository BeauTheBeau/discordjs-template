# Configuring the bot

## Configuration file

The bot is configured with a JavaScript file, `config.js`, which is loaded by the bot when it starts. This file is not
included in the repository and should not be committed to a repository, due to the sensitive information it contains.
Instead, a template file, `config.template.js`, is included, which can be copied and renamed to `config.js`, and then
filled in with the appropriate information.
